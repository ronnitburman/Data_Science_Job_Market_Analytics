# Data_Science_Job_Market_Analytics
Since I am actively looking for a job right not - I thought why not do a project that will analyze the current job market. This will help me better visualize the trends of the market and the oppurtunities and compensations that I can expect in the coming months.

To begin, I'll take a dataset from [ai-jobs.com](https://ai-jobs.net/) and perform exploratory data analysis to get a sense of the data. Once I understand the data better - I'll start performing visualization to get better intuition on the data. Further, the next steps will be to find various patterns or trends using machine learning methods.

I'll keep appending the report as I move forward in the project.
